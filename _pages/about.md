I am an undergraduate sophmore who enjoyes being involved with her campus. I manage my time well, collaborate effectively with others, prioritize my studies, and keep a good balance between work and pastime activities (i.e, playing tennis and painting). I am a creative learning and a determined worker seeking a job in the polymer and organic based industry. I find organic chemistry fascinating and I have love my experience working with polymer based manufacturing in the Digital Fabrication lab at my university.   

## Education

* Vanderbilt University (May 2025)
  * Bachelor of Engineering in Chemical Engineering
  * Chemistry Minor
  * Digital Fabrication Minor

## Work Experience

Digital Fabrication Lab (February 2022 - Present)

*Research Technician Assistant*
  * Research, manipulate, and debug programs for 5 different 3D printers in the lab
  * Assessed the properties of 8 various filaments and print items using each material
  * Designed an undergraduate research project that focuses on testing and analyzing the mechanical and molecular properties of recycled polyurethane elastomers and polylactic acid monomers
  * Trained and operated on a DSC machine, rheometer, filament extruder, pelletizer, and regrind machine

## Technical Skills

I can operate a number of different 3D printers and create CAD renderings on Fusion. My work with Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) has taught me how to produce and analyze the plastic polymers that are fed through the printers. I have expereince with the following machinery used in and for the fabrication lab:

* Fused Filament Fabrication printers
* Rheometer
* Differential Scanning Calorimeters (DSC)
* Pelletizer
* Filabot EX2 and EX6 filament extruders
* Regrinder

## Awards and Honors

* SAChe Certification (2022)
