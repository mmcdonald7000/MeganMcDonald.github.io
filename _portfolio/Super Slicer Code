These configuration files provide a simple and organized way for you to interact with the program SuperSlicer. You can take 3D models and convert them into G-code instructions for Voron 2 FFF printers. The files include code for a specific profile that I have created. This profile has settings and parameters for 8 different 3D printing filaments that have been manually set. To access this ability, copy these files into the 'vendor' file in your SuperSlicer zipfiles.
