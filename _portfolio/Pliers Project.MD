# Description
Snap-fit models are functional designs that are printed in separate components and assembled without the use of glue or tools. This method of additive maufacturing allows fast print times and variability in materials, colors, and attachments. For instance, the pliers in this project were printed on two separate printers that ran simultaneously, decreasing overall print time and introducing several materials such as PLA, ABS, and TPU filaments. An alternative method to obtaining an operative device is print-in-place parts. No post-processing or assembly is required, which means the model works immediately after removal from the print bed.

# Features
* **Materials** All dimensions for my phone were scaled to the iPhone 8. The thickness of the case on the back of the phone is 2 mm and the thickness of the case along the sides of the phone is 3 mm. These dimensions were chosen because if the wall thickness of the phone was less than 1.2 mm, then the case would have poor mechanical properties. I kept the back of the phone case at 2 mm because this thickness gave the phone case enough strength but didnâ€™t make the appearance of the phone too bulky or heavy. On the sides, however, I made the thickness 3 mm because this allowed enough support between the holes of the speakers and the charging port on the bottom of the phone. The drawback of this design choice is that it made the accessibility to the volume and power buttons a little more challenging. To compensate for this problem, the openings for the mute rocker and volume and power buttons were larger, with dimensions 5.48 mm X 12.62 mm. To prevent any structural support issues between the volume up button and volume down button, I made the access hole one large rectangle. The distance between these two buttons was too small to have a strong divider. For similar functionality reasons, the openings for the charging port and the speakers were made larger as well with dimensions 3.655 mm X 15.65 mm and 3.655 mm X 14.72 mm respectively. To protect the touchscreen without restricting the touch area, a lip was added to the top of the case. This lip was 3 mm inwardly offset from the inside edge of the case. This distance allowed the case to secure the phone without affecting the functionality of the camera, face and touch ID sensors, or touchscreen capabilities. It also left enough room for a glass screen protector to be added to the face of the phone. For the opening on the back of the phone for the camera, dimensions were set according to the housing surface. This ensured that the phone case would not interfere with the back camera.

* **Flexible Component** For the design of my phone case, I follow a music theme. There are black and white piano keys on one half of the back of the phone and a Spotify scan code the other half. Music is a very important part of my life, especially the piano. I played in several concerts and completed 10 years in the Nation Guild Auditions. The instrument ties back to my grandmother, who was an accomplished pianist that hid her talent after the tragic loss of her own musically inclined mother. The keys represent my connect to music, and I believe this design could have similar meaning or importance to others. The Spotify code on the other half is made from a series of lines that can be scanned through the Spotify app. This code leads to a playlist with music from my Spotify account. I think this modern feature would be very attractive to music listeners. This design choice makes for a good competitor because consumers can customize their phone cases with a Spotify code. This functional part serves as a way to share music, to advertise the Spotify app, or to express your interests in music.
