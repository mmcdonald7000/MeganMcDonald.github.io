# Description & Application
The concept of this specific microfluidic device is known as “pinch flow fractionation”. In this method, particles of different sizes are suspended in liquid and continuously introduced into a microchannel having a pinched segment by another liquid flow without particles. The particles are forced against the side wall of the pinched segment and separate according to size at a 90o angle from the flow direction into a 1 mm wide segment. Also, separated particles are collected independently in branches at the end of the broadened segment. The separation of the particles can be assessed under a microscope. Pinched flow fractionation can be applied for particle size analysis and for preparation of monodispersed particle because the separation can be performed quickly and continuously. For the design of this device, the focus was to separate blood cell particles.

# Desgin
The microfluidic device was created using a mold, which was produced by the high-resolution printing capabilities of the Form 3 SLA printers in the Digital Fabrication Lab at Vanderbilt University. Vat photopolymerization was the chosen technique to create the mold because the printer could create small precise dimensions needed for the mold and had watertight material properties. The mold was cast with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and bonded to a glass slide. The device, when molded, was precisely 25mm wide by 75 mm long to sit flush on a common microscope slide. For the design of the device, there were two input flows, one with different sized particles suspended in liquid and the other with liquid without particles, tapering into a pinched segment. For inlets and outlets, 2.0 mm posts ran up to the top of the mold. This created a hold that was compatible with the microfluidic tubing. The flow rates of the inputs were optimized so that the particles would be forced uniformly against the side wall of the pinched segment and separated according to size in a broadened segment. After separation, the different sized particles were collected independently in 3 branched channels from the broadened segment. 

# 3D Printed Mold to Device
Once the 3D printed mold was removed and cleaned from the SLA printer, the 3D-printed mold was coated with a “non-stick” substance to facilitate the successful casting of PDMS. To cast the mold, a solution of SYLGARD™ 184 Silicone Elastomer was thoroughly mixed so that there were no bubbles. The mold was filled with the solution and set in a vacuum drying oven. The cured PDMS was removed from the mold and bonded to a glass slide. The device was then set up with inlet and outlet microfluidic tubing for particle separation.
