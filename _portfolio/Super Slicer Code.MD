These configuration files provide a simple and organized way for you to interact with the program SuperSlicer. You can take 3D models and convert them into G-code instructions for Voron 2 FFF printers. The files include code for a specific profile that I have created. This profile has settings and parameters for 8 different 3D printing filaments that have been manually set. To access this ability, copy [file_1](https://vanderbilt365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/megan_n_mcdonald_vanderbilt_edu/EY4sLDvKz4tCgaOmNnPaaloBCTWww69SbL99BhjZhLwXrA?e=debhPa) and [file_2](https://vanderbilt365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/megan_n_mcdonald_vanderbilt_edu/ESOE5P6mmNxKoHXJVQkWE5gB9pM5hSTE40uMdaD9twFEGQ?e=6zyQqn) into the 'vendor' file in your SuperSlicer zipfiles.
